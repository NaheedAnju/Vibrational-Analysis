# Vibrational Analysis of Motors: Early Fault Detection Project

This project involves vibrational analysis of motors for early fault detection using an Arduino and an accelerometer. The data is processed in a Jupyter notebook environment. The following steps will guide you through setting up the environment and running the project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (preferably version 3.7 or later)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sehaj-kahlon/Vibrational-Analysis.git
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. To create one, follow these steps:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install the Required Libraries

Install all the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies required for the project.
